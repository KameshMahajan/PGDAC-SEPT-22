/*
Write a Java program to find the median of the number inside the window (size k) at each 
moving in a given array of integers with duplicate numbers. Move the window from the start 
of the array. [1 Mark]
Example:
{|1, 2, 3|, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8} -> Return median 2
{1, |2, 3, 4|, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8} -> Return median 3
{1, 2, |3, 4, 5|, 6, 7, 8, 8} -> Return median 4
{1, 2, 3, |4, 5, 6|, 7, 8, 8} -> Return median 5
{1, 2, 3, 4, |5, 6, 7|, 8, 8} -> Return median 6
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, |6, 7, 8|, 8} -> Return median 7
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, |7, 8, 8|} -> Return median 8
Result array {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Note: Above representation is just example, use scanner class for input the array and for 
getting size of window to slide
